                Below you will find the complete list of 88 sample teacher
                interview questions. These questions are quite common for high
                school, middle school, and elementary teacher interviews. The
                difficulty level of these questions vary from easy to more
                difficult, but all of which are typical of a standard interview.
                When given an interview as a teacher, it is important to realize
                that you can prepare for it just as you would for an important
                test.
